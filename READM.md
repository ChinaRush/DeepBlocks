# DeepBlocks
This repo aims to provide an whole Library for deeplearning training models in Obeject Detection.As we konw, each model can be viewed as three parts, backbone, neck and head.so DeepBlocks is here, you can use every elements in it to implement your deep neural networks.all codes are implemented in PyTorch.
