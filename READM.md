# DeepBlocks
This repo aims to provide an whole Library for deeplearning training models in Obeject detection.As we konw, each model can be viewed as three parts, backbone, neck and head.so DeepBlocks is here, you can use every elements in it to implment your deep neural networks.Have a joy, our code in implmented in PyTorch.
